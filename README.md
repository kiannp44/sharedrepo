## Samuel and Kian shared repo

Our plan of a math library will include a bunch of math functions and calculators that we don't completely understand or have forgotten. This can be seen with the first week's signficant figures calculator. We don't really remember how significant figures worked, so buy making this calculator, it helps us learn and refresh our memory on how they work. We have started easier with stuff we already know and stuff that just uses purely numbers, but we want to try making calculators that do things with variables. If possible we want to do things with maybe the quadratic formula or find the derivative of something, which could be interesting. Collaboratively, we could look over each other's code and help with anything if needed or also work on parts of a math function together.

### Week 2

This week we both are working on seperate math operations on our own repos and will put them together in one menu on our shared repo once they are 100% complete.
